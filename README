Shows all my Python Projects done via courses individually
The further down the the items on the list, the more complex the projects are
For most of the projects, as the course answer is different from mine, I have included both my take on the project as well as the course's answer
All the projects done are from the following courses:
- 100 Days of Code: The complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr Angela Yu
- The Complete Python Developer By Andrei Negoie
